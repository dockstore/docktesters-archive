Dear All,

You have been added to the docktesters at lists.icgc.org<mailto:docktesters at lists.icgc.org> mailman list.

Kyle, I haven?t added you yet, as you haven?t responded to my invitation, and
will keep you on the CC line until I hear from you. Nina is my admin assistant,
and minds my schedule. Currently on the list I have these people:

? ohofmann72 at gmail.com<mailto:ohofmann72 at gmail.com>
? junjun.zhang at oicr.on.ca<mailto:junjun.zhang at oicr.on.ca>
? marc.perry at oicr.on.ca<mailto:marc.perry at oicr.on.ca>
? miguel.vazquez at cnio.es<mailto:miguel.vazquez at cnio.es>
? Brian.OConnor at oicr.on.ca<mailto:Brian.OConnor at oicr.on.ca>
? francis at oicr.on.ca<mailto:francis at oicr.on.ca>

I would like to have our first conference call after the next PCAWG-tech call
(those are at 9:00 AM ETD, so next docktesters conf call would be at 10:00 EDT
look at attached image for a time zone near you).

I will also have an agenda up on wiki before then as well, but it will consist of us
brainstorming on what it is we need to have to get the testing of a docker
container from the dockstore tested by all of us.

Our current wiki is here: https://goo.gl/3r553c

Please complete data access permissions, as well as any note I should know
about. Also feel free to recommend other people that should partake in this
activity.

Many thanks, and hope to talk to you all next week.

Thanks
