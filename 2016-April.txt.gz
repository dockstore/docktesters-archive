Ola docktesters,

I added Brian?s Barcelona talk to the ?home? of docktester. https://goo.gl/eWJuii
(also attached)

Sorry I wasn?t there, and be assured, that this testing groupo is currently quiet,
but will awaken soon!

Thank you for your slide deck (which I found on the pcawg-tech page),

cheers to all,

@bfoo

question for Denis/Solomon/Brian (and others who may know):

On the dockstore page I see two docker?s with the name ?PCAWG? in them, is that an
official rule for PCAWG tools, they must have ?PCAWG? as a prefix?

So far I see two PCAWG dockers in the store (see attached image).

Message-ID: <EA163472-84EA-4ACE-8E2E-2326E9CDAF14@oicr.on.ca>

Dear Docktester?s

Two things coming up this week:

1- Thursday April 21 PCAWG network call, and Brian is giving a talk/overview on how to Dockerize things.
   https://wiki.oicr.on.ca/display/PANCANCER/2016-04-21+PCAWG-Network+Teleconference
2- Friday call with Brian, Christina and all from docktester who want to join. It will
    be late for Europeans (apologies) ? 17:00 Toronto (14:00 west coast and others shown below.

I will do my best at taking notes, and see what we can make available after call ? Maybe even record
the call?

Main agenda of call on Friday will be what we need to do to get starting on testing.

I will put call info and agenda on our wiki page in next day or so.

Talk to you later,

@bffo

Hi Francis and Group,

Just to clarify (1) below, I?m just going to give a 10 minute overview of Dockstore and why it?s useful for PCAWG on this particular call.  My allocation of time is too short to actually give a tutorial.  Instead, I?m going to give a 1 hour in-depth tutorial over google hangouts in early May.  I?ll let the group know when this will be once I nail down a date.

Thanks

Brian

Any chance we could do this meeting a few hours earlier ? Would
be a bit easier for our European friends!

Brian,

What other time on Friday?

Europeans on list? How late can you attend?

Currently set for 22:00 on Friday!  A bit late, imho.
(and 23:00 in Barcelona)

But of nobody from Europe can attend, I will have
notes/suggestions for us to discuss SOP.

Many thanks to all,

How about 10am Pacific time on Friday?  That?s the only other time slot I have free :-(

I check OICR emails about once a day.  At least for the next ~2 months while I still have the account.

Great,

Let?s make it make 10:00 Pacific work.

fyi, 11 people on this list now, all of which are also listed on:

https://wiki.oicr.on.ca/x/9pfnAw

Please have a look at the terms of reference I added for this working group, as a result of
our discussion on Friday, and also from discussions I had with Christina after the call:

https://wiki.oicr.on.ca/x/GYD9Aw

SOPs and responsibilities are still, in my understanding, still very much under discussion.

Cheers,

@bffo
