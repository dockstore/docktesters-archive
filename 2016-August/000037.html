Dear Docktesters,

Sorry I&#8217;ve quiet for last couple of months. I&#8217;ve been at the hospital supporting my partner,
and she passed away 2.5 weeks ago, and i am now getting back into the swing of things.

She died of complications related to her breast/bone and liver cancer, and so I am
now even more (although I was already very much there) dedicated to doing something
about this friggen disease!

So, what do we need to do? Well, first and foremost we need to agree on an SOP on what
we need to do to test these containers. For that I would like for us to meet this week.
Meeting with people from west coast to Europe time zones is difficult, but we should manage
at least once, and then, we can follow-up via e-mail, or documentation on the wiki.

As a reminder, the docktester&#8217;s wiki page is here: <A HREF="https://wiki.oicr.on.ca/x/9pfnAw">https://wiki.oicr.on.ca/x/9pfnAw</A>

And on this page I added two recent links that Brian put together in my absence:


  *   Workflow testing SOP&lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.oicr.on.ca/display/PANCANCER/Workflow+Testing+SOP">https://wiki.oicr.on.ca/display/PANCANCER/Workflow+Testing+SOP</A>&gt;
  *   Workflow testing Data&lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.oicr.on.ca/display/PANCANCER/Workflow+Testing+Data">https://wiki.oicr.on.ca/display/PANCANCER/Workflow+Testing+Data</A>&gt;

We need to agree on the SOP, and that is what our next discussion will be about.

I&#8217;ve added Zhibin Lu to this mailing list. Zhibin is somebody from my group that will work
with you and provide you, should you need it, some AWS dollars/CPU etc should you need
somewhere to test.

I will set up a doodle later today, and I would really like for us to meet this week.

Thank you for your effort in making this happen, and getting this testing started.

Talk to some of you later today on the PCAWG-tech call,

@bffo
