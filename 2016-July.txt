Hi,

Is there another meeting scheduled for the PCAWG testing group?  I?d like to give a tutorial on calling the workflows we have in Dockstore in order to help move the testing process forward.

Sorry all,

I've been out of the picture for last few weeks, taking care of my partner Jennie with cancer and surgery. I'm off for another's week (using up my weeks of vacation) and I will try and renter workforce, and hope to manage this important working group.

In the next few days I will send out a doodle poll for a 2 hr conf call that I hope all (very few of us) can attend, so we can get things going for the important testing. If our tests fail, docker container people will have work to do!

I hope we can do this important job. If you can suggest a few more dock tester members (from your respective groups, or others you think already in the PCAWG family that could help), that would be great -- please pass me their names.

More later in next few days,

All the best,

Francis
