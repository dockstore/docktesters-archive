Subject: [DOCKTESTERS] FW: UPDATE: There are now four Docker images
 available for PCAWG Workflows,
 and Brian is planning a Dockstore Tutorial for next week
Message-ID: <C05BD76ADF6E2F43B40D03CBBE465B1DCB55B152@exmb2.ad.oicr.on.ca>

Hi All,

I tried to send out this Email last week and now realize why I did not get a response: I mangled the Email address by switching two of terms.  So, in the interim, Brian has had a terrific response to his Webinar Tutorial poll and the first one will be held this Thursday, June 16th, 2016 at 9:00 A.M. PDT.  So if you are able to participate in that it will probably we worthwhile.  During today's weekly PCAWG-Tech call he mentioned that not everyone who is interested will be able to attend that time so he may offer this first one again.

We would like to have another Docktesters TC as soon as possible, and I was wondering if next Monday would suit us (see below).

Thanks,
-- Marc

Subject: UPDATE: There are now four Docker images available for PCAWG Workflows, and Brian is planning a Dockstore Tutorial for next week

Hi Docktesters,

You may not have heard but Francis is going to be out of action for the next week (approx.) and he asked me to schedule the next teleconference for our PCAWG Docker Testing Working Group.  Since our inaugural TC was held on a Monday, right after the PCAWG Technical Working Group's weekly TC (that has been held at 9:00  A.M. Eastern Time for many months), I was wondering if either Monday, June 13, 2016, or Monday, June 20, 2016, at 10:00 A.M. (currently UTC-04:00) would work for the majority of us?
Please reply and let me know your availability for both of those time slots at your earliest convenience.  If is just not going to work then I will create a Doodle Poll for you to fill in.

Other news:
If you have been joining in on the Weekly PCAWG-Tech calls then you know that Brian et al., have now released four Docker images to www.dockstore.org<http://www.dockstore.org>, and these all need to be tested.  I have updated the wiki page for our group and the links and details are listed here: https://wiki.oicr.on.ca/display/PANCANCER/PCAWG+Docker+%28Dockstore%29+Testing+Working+Group (scroll down to the table at the bottom of the page).  I am also creating a page that will have an SOP describing how to get up and running.

As we discussed at our last conference call back at the end of April, Brian is also going to be holding some Tutorial Webinars.  These are going to be an introduction to Dockstore itself, and also cover how to build a Docker image from a Github repository.  At yesterday's PCAWG-Tech TC he included a link to a Doodle Poll for the best time to hold the first one of these (sometime next week): http://doodle.com/poll/isqtfqzgcw2q9i9s so please fill that out, as I think it will extremely instructive (even if we are testers, and not software developers).

Thanks,
-- Marc

Hi Everyone,

I have two items I wanted to share ahead of the call tomorrow.  The first is the slide-pack I will use for the first part of the tutorial.  See:

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12ZbaQIPqyOApfuaIH_ulOJwlBDzaECwDdbTFrnhagGg/edit?usp=sharing

and the second is the tutorial I will walk the group through:

https://github.com/ga4gh/dockstore/wiki/Dockstore-New-Developer-Tutorial

Also, just as a reminder I will use Google Hangouts on Air, the URL is:

Hi Everyone,

For those of you that missed the Docker tutorial today I will give a repeat tutorial hosted at UCSC (and online) sometime next week.  If you?re interested, vote for your preferred time here:

http://doodle.com/poll/7wuke8w5ykirgehe

If this proves useful we?ll develop more advanced tutorials describing how to build workflows and run them on various clouds.

Hope this helps!

Brian

Hi Docktesters,

I apologize for not notifying you about this last week.  I only heard back from one of the actual "testers" so I decided to (a) follow-up individually with the members of this list, and then (b) find a mutually convenient time for next teleconference.

Thanks,

We are a small group, so let?s try and work and try and find a time where we can
all meet together, and not have to do multiple calls.
