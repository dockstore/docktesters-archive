<PRE>Hi All,

I tried to send out this Email last week and now realize why I did not get a response: I mangled the Email address by switching two of terms.  So, in the interim, Brian has had a terrific response to his Webinar Tutorial poll and the first one will be held this Thursday, June 16th, 2016 at 9:00 A.M. PDT.  So if you are able to participate in that it will probably we worthwhile.  During today's weekly PCAWG-Tech call he mentioned that not everyone who is interested will be able to attend that time so he may offer this first one again.

We would like to have another Docktesters TC as soon as possible, and I was wondering if next Monday would suit us (see below).

Thanks,
-- Marc

Hi Docktesters,

You may not have heard but Francis is going to be out of action for the next week (approx.) and he asked me to schedule the next teleconference for our PCAWG Docker Testing Working Group.  Since our inaugural TC was held on a Monday, right after the PCAWG Technical Working Group's weekly TC (that has been held at 9:00  A.M. Eastern Time for many months), I was wondering if either Monday, June 13, 2016, or Monday, June 20, 2016, at 10:00 A.M. (currently UTC-04:00) would work for the majority of us?
Please reply and let me know your availability for both of those time slots at your earliest convenience.  If is just not going to work then I will create a Doodle Poll for you to fill in.

Other news:
If you have been joining in on the Weekly PCAWG-Tech calls then you know that Brian et al., have now released four Docker images to www.dockstore.org&lt;<A HREF="http://www.dockstore.org">http://www.dockstore.org</A>&gt;, and these all need to be tested.  I have updated the wiki page for our group and the links and details are listed here: <A HREF="https://wiki.oicr.on.ca/display/PANCANCER/PCAWG+Docker+%28Dockstore%29+Testing+Working+Group">https://wiki.oicr.on.ca/display/PANCANCER/PCAWG+Docker+%28Dockstore%29+Testing+Working+Group</A> (scroll down to the table at the bottom of the page).  I am also creating a page that will have an SOP describing how to get up and running.

As we discussed at our last conference call back at the end of April, Brian is also going to be holding some Tutorial Webinars.  These are going to be an introduction to Dockstore itself, and also cover how to build a Docker image from a Github repository.  At yesterday's PCAWG-Tech TC he included a link to a Doodle Poll for the best time to hold the first one of these (sometime next week): <A HREF="http://doodle.com/poll/isqtfqzgcw2q9i9s">http://doodle.com/poll/isqtfqzgcw2q9i9s</A> so please fill that out, as I think it will extremely instructive (even if we are testers, and not software developers).

Thanks,
-- Marc
