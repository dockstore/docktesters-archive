Subject: [DOCKTESTERS] Outside access
Message-ID: <3033d21ff2a54d5aa1ee7ef961c2ca35@oicr.on.ca>

Hi,


We've had a few questions about the various PCAWG workflows and there is content here in the Docktesters archive that would be useful. However, to my surprise, it doesn't seem like the archives (linked from https://lists.icgc.org/mailman/listinfo/docktesters ) are actually browse-able from outside OICR. So I have a few follow-up questions.


1) Is this correct or is there actually a simple way of viewing the mailing list archives outside OICR?

2) Would people have any objection to exporting the content or somehow making the archives publicly available (maybe after the PCAWG-TECH paper is out?)

3) Would it make sense for this group to evolve to something more publicly facing like Google Groups in the future?


Thoughts?
